different ways to define a pentagon

1. equal sides

2. equal central angles on circle

3. equal vertex angles

4. composed of iso ∆, angle ratios 1:2:2, 3:1:1


2 => 1
easy

1 => 2 
draw circumcircle for ∆AED, ∆ABE
same center

1 => 4
∆AED is iso, so outside angles at vertices are eq
let them be x and
let vertex < CAD = y
let outside vertex angles = y
y + 4x = 3y + x
x = y
