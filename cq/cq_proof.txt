Given that $ABDC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Let $BD$ bisect $\angle CBE$.  Prove that $DC = DA$.

Proof.

We will show that $\angle DCA = \angle DAC$.

Let $\beta$ be one-half the bisected external angle.

\[ \beta $\angle DBE \]

$\angle DAC$ is on arc $CD$ so $\angle DAC = \beta$.

$\angle DCA$ is supplementary to $\angle ABD$ by the fundamental theorem of the cyclic quadrilateral

And then $\angle ABD$ supplementary to $\beta$ on the straight line $ABE$.

So $\angle DCA = \beta = \angle DAC$.

It follows that $\triangle DCA$ is isosceles, with $DC = DA$.
