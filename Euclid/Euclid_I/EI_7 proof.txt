Let AC = AD.  

By I.5, < ACD = < ADC.

Since < ACD is larger than < BCD and < ADC is smaller than < BDC.

It follows that < BCD is smaller than < BDC.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose BC = BD.

By I.5, < BCD = < BDC.

This is a contradiction.

-----

In the right panel, we still have that by I.5, < ACD = < ADC.

The supplementary angles are also equal:

< EDC = < FCD.

< EDC is larger than < BDC, and < FCD is smaller than < BCD.

It follows that < BDC is smaller than < BCD.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose BC = BD.

By I.5, < BCD = < BDC.

This is a contradiction.
