Equilateral triangle properties.

Draw the circumcircle.  Draw the diameter through C, hitting D and M.

(1) given equal sides AB = AC = BC.

(2) equal angles at A, B, C by isosceles twice, or inscribed angles on equal arcs.

(3) < CAD and < CBD are both right, by Thales theorem.

(4) tri CAD cong tri CBD by HL.

(5) -> AD = BD

(6) -> CD bisects < C by inscribed angles on equal arcs.

(7) AQ = DQ = BQ as radii of the circle

(8) -> QAD is isosceles

(9) -> < QAD = < QDA

(10) But < QDA = < B, so QAD is equilateral

(11) AD and DB are also equal to radii.

(12) AQBD is a parallelogram (two pairs of equal sides).

(13) M bisects both AB and QD.

(14) Four congruent triangles with right angles at M by SSS.

(Actually, 13 is a general result for any triangle).

(15) CQM is bisector, median and altitude of tri ABC and Q is incenter, centroid and orthocenter as well.
