proof 1

mark off E | BD = ED
so tri MBE is iso
mark off H | MB = MH
draw AH and AM

blue dots:  isosceles triangle
red dots:   inscribed angle thm

< MBE = red + < HMA:  inscribed < thm
< BEM = red + < AME
hence purple dots

tri HMA cong tri EMA by ASA
AE = AH

AH = GB
AE = GB
AE + ED = GB + BD
= AD

proof 2

extend AB to Z | MZ = MA and DZ = DZ
tri MZA is isosceles
draw GZ, GBand GM

< BGM = < MAB = < MZD:  inscribed < thm and isosceles
MG = MA = MZ:  given and isosceles
whole < Z = whole < G
subtract blue
tri BZG is isosceles

ZD = AD
ZB + BD = AD
GD + BD = AD

-----

proof 3

as before, blues are equal
MB is shared
MG = MA = MZ

so comparing tri ZBM and GBM
we have SSA
< ZBM is obtuse (b/c external to rt + another)
< GBM also obtuse b/c subtends arc > 1/2 circle
therefore tri congurent

-----

proof 4

find Z | BG = AZ
given MG = MA
blue:  inscribed angle thm

tri BMG cong tri ZMA by SAS
-> MB = MZ
tri MBZ is iso
BD = BZ

AZ + ZD = BG + BD
= AD

-----

proof 5

proof 6

proof 7

draw circle on center M with radius MA = MG
extend AB to meet the circle at Z

< BGM = < A by inscribed angles
< MZD = < A by isosceles triangle
blue angles by inscribed angles

< BZG = < BGZ by subtraction
ZBG is iso and BG = BZ

given MD perp
AZ is a chord and MD perp through center
therefore is is a bisector
AD = ZD = ZB + BD = GB + BD

-----

proof 8

extend GB to Z | MZ perp GZ

< MBG is supplementary to < MBZ
< MBZ lies on arc MAG
< MBG corresponds to arc MG

but MG = MA and
< MBD lies on arc MA
hence the red dots

but then tri MBZ and MBD share two angles and one side
so they are congruent
ZB = BD

Now consider tri MZG and MDA
both are right
< A = < G
MG = MA
so they are congruent with 
AD = GZ = GB + BZ = GB + BD

-----

proof 9

Extend MD to the circle at Z
draw MK as a diameter of the circle
find where MK crosses AG at T
draw AG
draw LK perp AB

The angle at Z is right by Thales circle thm
MZ parallel LK
ZK parallel DL
ZK = DL

b/c parallel
< ZKM = < LKM
b/c similar
< A = < LKM = < M
BG = ZK = DL

But AL = BD by rectangle in circle

BD + BG = AL + DL = AD
