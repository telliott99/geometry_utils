Ptolemy gives us
c^2 = b^2 + a^2 + 2abd

We need to obtain an expression for d.

If s is the obtuse angle in âˆ†ABC
Let its opposite angle be t
in the triangle with sides h,b,d

Then s and t are supplementary
so cos s = - cos t
cos t = d/b

d = b cos t = - b cos s 

substituting
c^2 = b^2 + a^2 - 2ab cos s

show this still works if s is acute
