Given two pgrams on the same base AB with the other points collinear on DEGF, then they have the same area.

We will show that ∆ ADG cong ∆ BEF.

By the properties of pgrams, DE = AB = GF.
Adding equals, DG = EF.

Since AB parallel DEGF, < ADE = < BEF.  

By properties of pgrams AD = BE.

Congruence follows by SAS.

(∆ADG) = (ADEX) + (EXG).
Subtract (EXG) and add (ABX) to obtain (ABED).

(∆BEF) = (BXGF) + (EXG).
Subtract (EXG) and add (ABX) to obtain (ABFG).
