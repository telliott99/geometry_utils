1. both pairs of sides parallel
2. both pairs of sides equal
3. opposite angles equal
4. one pair both parallel and equal

1 => 2
AB parallel DC
AD parallel BC

< DAC = < BCA
< BAC = < DCA
∆tri DAC cong ∆BCA by ASA
AB = AC

for the same reason
AD = BC

2 => 1
∆DAB cong ∆BCD by SSS
<ABD = <CDB
AB parallel DC

for the same reason AD parallel BC

3 => 1
by alternate interior angles 
  AB parallel DC
  AD parallel BC

4 => 1
AB parallel DC and AB = DC
equal angles by alternate interior angles
∆DMC cong ∆BMA by ASA

AM = MC
DM = BM
∆AMD cong ∆CMB by SAS
<DAM = <CBM
AD parallel BC

1 => 3
just add angles at the corners

2 => 4
AB = DC
AD = BC
∆DAB cong ∆BCD by SSS
< ADB = < CBD
AD parallel BC
