For triangle ABC draw the incircle and excircle as usual.

Draw triangle KLM on the midpoints of the sides.

We have four congruent half-size triangles.


Draw the F circle on center K and radius KX.

Find Xa on side a where the circle on K cuts it.


Find S where AIN crosses side a.

Draw the crossed tangents SX and ST.

Extend them to B and B1, also C and C1.

Find where STB1 cuts the tri KLM at B' and C'.


KX is a diameter of the Fcircle with KX = KXa.

We a bunch of similar triangles some cong.

LKBM is a pgram (two pairs opp sides parallel).

B1C1 and BC are tangent to both excircle and incircle crossing at S.

We have SB1 = SB (by ASA and cong tri), and also SC = SC1.

ABC cong AB1C1.

Also AC parallel KM and LK parallel AB, 
so tri LB1B' sim tri KC'B' sim MC'C1.

KTS also sim
